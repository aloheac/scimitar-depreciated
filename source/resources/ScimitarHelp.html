<h1>Scimitar User Documentation</h1>
<h2>Version 6.0.1 beta (Apr 2015)</h2>
    
<h2>What is Scimitar?</h2>
Scimitar is an visual application designed for large parameter-space exploration
of numerical simulations in the physical sciences. This software is designed to
work with custom numerical simulation applications which accepts a given set
of parameters as input to produce some result. Scimitar automates the process
of configuring, organizing, executing, and monitoring a large number of runs
on single machine or a large computing cluster which iterate over one or more
parameters. In the broadest sense, Scimitar takes an \embarrassingly parallel"
approach by using an allocated set of computing resources and simultaneously
executing many lightly-threaded instances of a simulation at once. In practice,
Scimitar's goal is to automatically generate a Python script which will easily
execute an instance of a program for each combination of selected parameters in
a highly organized fashion, which simplifies data reduction and post-processing.
Once configured to your computing environment, for a given run Scimitar will
<ul>
    <li>compile your program from source, if requested,</li>
    <li>create a directory tree for all combinations of given parameters,</li>
    <li>generate a parameter inpute file for each instance of a run,</li>
    <li>and submit jobs to a PBS cluster or execute jobs on a single machine.</li>
</ul>
Scimitar is an application developed by the group of Joaquin E. Drut in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. Its development is supported in part by the U.S. National Science
Foundation under Grant No. PHY1306520 and under the Graduate Research
Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE1144081.
    
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
The Scimitar application will run on any modern Linux distribution, Mac OS X,
and Windows 7/8, but the generated scripts are designed to work only with Lin-
ux/UNIX operating systems. Scimitar binaries provided by the research group
does not require any external dependencies; all libraries are compiled within the
executable. If running Scimitar from source, the following dependencies must
also be installed:
<ul>
    <li>Python 2.7+</li>
    <li>wxPython 3.0 or greater</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Configuring a Run</h2>
<h3>Parameter Grid</h3>
The parameter grid configures the set of parameters, their types, and values
that will be passed to the executed program. The grid contains four columns:
<ul>
    <li><b>Parameter:</b> The unique name of a parameter to be passed to the exe-
cuting program. The parameter name must begin with a letter and must
not contain any spaces or backslashes.</li>
    <li><b>Type:</b> The type of the parameter. Details about supported types are
given below.</li>
    <li><b>Value(s):</b> The values that the parameter will take. If only a single value
is given, all runs will execute with this same value. If multiple values are
given, whether in the form of a list or range, a run will execute for each
combination of values.</li>
    <li><b>Directory Order:</b> Specifies the order in which multiple parameters will
be nested within the generated directory structure. These values are consecutive 
integers beginning with 1, and each value must be unique. At
least one parameter must have a directory order entered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supported Data Types</h3>
There are multiple data types supported by Scimitar which are entered into the
'Type' column of the parameter grid. These types and a description of each are
<ul>
    <li><tt>int</tt>: An integer (as specified in the Python implementation). Integers
may also be given as a list of values (i.e. 1,2,3).</li>
    <li><tt>real</tt>: A 
oating-point number (as specified in the Python implementation as a float). 
Reals may also be given as a list of values (i.e. 2.7,3.14,7.34,6.3).</li>
    <li><tt>string</tt>: A string of text enclosed in quotes (i.e. "Hello, world!").</li>
</ul>
The data types <tt>range</tt> and <tt>int</tt> may also be given as a 
multi-valued type which gives a range of values from a minimum to
a maximum, in intervals of a given step size. The syntax for a range is
min:step size:max. For example, to iterate over values that begin at 1.0
and and at 5.0 in steps of 0.2, enter 1.0:0.2:5.0. All values in a range
are handled as floating-point numbers.
<h3>Global Run Properties</h3>
    The second panel of the <i>Scimitar Run Editor</i>, <i>Run Configuration</i> sets a variety
of basic settings that are global to all modules, independent of the selected
resource manager. Listed below are the available settings, a description of each
and any key points to note.
<ul>
    <li><b>Script filename:</b> The filename of the script that will be generated by
the run. Note that this script is a standard Python 2.x script, and should
have a .py file extension.</li>
    <li><b>Script output location:</b> The local directory that Scimitar should save
the script to. This directory is independent of the script execution location.</li>
    <li><b>Run notes:</b> A space to enter any personal information about a run.</li>
    <li><b>Output filename:</b> The file that each executable will redirect STDOUT and
STDERR to. Note that Scimitar overwrites any existing file, and does not
append to it by default.</li>
    <li><b>Executable filename:</b> The name of the executable file that will be called by the Scimitar script.</li>
    <li><b>Input filename:</b> Filename of the parameter input file that will be piped
into the executable or passed as an argument to the executable (see '<i>Disable input redirection</i>' ). 
This input file is automatically generated by Scimitar, and uses Scimitar's standardized input format.</li>
    <li><b>Source path:</b> Path to the source files of the executable or a path to a
copy of the executable if the program will not be recompiled from source.</li>
    <li><b>Compile executable from source:</b> Scimitar will first recompile the ex-
ecutable from source using the Makefile provided in the source directory,
if enabled.</li>
    <li><b>Build directory structure:</b> Scimitar will build the run directory struc-
ture for this run. Typically this should always be set to True unless a run
has been changed and is being restarted.</li>
    <li><b>Disable input redirection:</b> By default Scimitar passes in the set of
parameters by redirecting the input to STDIN (i.e. if the executable is
a.out the executable will be called with ./a.out < parameters.in). If
this option is set to True, the name of the parameter file will be passed
as an argument to the executable so the parameters can be loaded by
the program alternatively. This can be handled easily using the included
Scimitar C++ and Python libraries.</li>
    <li><b>Generate check status script:</b> Generate check status script: If enabled, a Python script will be
generated upon execution that will print out the last five lines of the
output file of each run to the terminal. This is useful for checking the
progress and validity of a run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the Resource Manager</h3>
A resource manager in Scimitar is the method by which the executable will
be run; whether it is simply on a single machine or a submission to a PBS/-
TORQUE managed cluster. The currently available resource managers are
<ul>
    <li><b>Single Machine or Interactive Job (Recovery Enabled):</b> This re-
source manager should be used when running a job on a single machine
or in an interactive job of a PBS managed cluster. This module is capable
of restarting a run at the point where the last job completed should the
Scimitar script be prematurely aborted. To restart a run, simply execute
the Scimitar Python script again.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Number of simultaneous runs:</b> The maximum number of runs
that will execute at any given type. Typically this should not be the
total number of cores available in a system. At least two cores should
be left to handle file I/O and other operating system related tasks.</li>
        <li><b>Process status check delay:</b> The frequency which the Scimitar
Python script will check for completed runs, and start new ones if
necessary. If this frequency is too high, the script may begin to utilize
significant CPU resources.</li>
        <li><b>Additional pre-execution commands:</b> Additional commands to
be called before running the main executable. Note that multiple
commands may easily be entered by launching the dialog box by
clicking the button that appears on the right-hand side of the text
box.</li>
        <li><b>Additional post-execution commands:</b> Additional commands to
be called after the main executable completes.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <li><b>PBS Scheduler on Cluster:</b> This resource manager should be used when submitting all jobs to the PBS/TORQUE resource manager on a cluster.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Number of nodes:</b> The numbe rof nodes that the resource manager should reserve for each executable. This corresponds to the <tt>nodes=</tt> parameter of the resource allocation in a PBS bash script.</li>
        <li><b>Processors per node (ppn):</b> Number of processors the resource manager should reserve for each executable.</li>
        <li><b>Walltime:</b> THe maximum amount of time the resource manager should allow the executable to run.</li>
        <li><b>Additional pre-execution commands:</b> Additional commands to
be called before running the main executable. Note that multiple
commands may easily be entered by launching the dialog box by
clicking the button that appears on the right-hand side of the text
box.</li>
        <li><b>Additional post-execution commands:</b> Additonal commands to be called after the main executable completes.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    
<h2>Executing a Run</h2>
The execution script that Scimitar generates is a standard Python script that
can be executed using Python 2.x. This file contains all of the information
necessary to start a run, given that the executable and any necessary libraries are
installed and configured on the system that will host the run. Simply copy the
Python script to any empty directory and execute the script to start the run (i.e.
<tt>python myscript.py</tt>). If submitting to a cluster, be sure the PBS/TORQUE
scheduler is first loaded.

<h2>Scimitar API Libraries</h2>
Scimitar provides simple API libraries to easily load the generated parameter
input files into your developed simulation or application. These libraries are
currently provided for Python and C++, although the format of the input file
is trivially adaptable for FORTRAN. The standard syntax for a parameter in
the parameter file is <tt>value #parameter-name</tt> where each value/parameter
pair is given on a single line.

<h3>Python Implementation</h3>
The following listing demonstrates typical usage of the library to import a parameter file:<br/>
<div class="boxed">
    parser = ScimitarInputParser()<br/>
    parser.setFilename( "parameter.in" )<br/>
    parser.loadParameters()<br/><br/>
    
    # Import parameter values using a dictionary.<br/>
    params = parser.getDictionary()<br/>
    alpha = int( params[ "alpha" ] )<br/>
    beta = float( params[ "beta" ] )<br/>
</div>
    
<h4>Public class methods:</h4>
Constructor: <tt>ScimitarInputParser(filename="")</tt><br/>

    <ul>
        <li><tt>filename</tt>: (string) Name of the Scimitar parameter file to load.</li>
    </ul>
<br/>

<tt>loadParameters()</tt><br/>
Loads the parameters from the specified input file into a dictionary where the parameter description (specified after the '<tt>#</tt>' in the input file) is paired with the parameter value.<br/><br/>

<tt>getDictionary()</tt><br/>
Returns a copy of the dictionary generated by the <tt>loadParameters()</tt> call.<br/><br/>

<tt>getList()</tt><br/>

        <li><tt>filename</tt>: (string) Name of the Scimitar parameter file to load.</li>
    </ul>
<br/>
    
<h3>C++ Implementation</h3>
A C++ implementation of the Scimitar API library is complete, but documentation for this library must still be written.
